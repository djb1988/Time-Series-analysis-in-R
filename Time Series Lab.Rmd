## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
```{r chunk 2}
x = rnorm(1000)
hist(x)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

$$ x_t
= .5 x_{t-1} +Z_t $$



```{r chunk 4}
phi1 <- 0.9
sigmaz <- 0.5
y <- arima.sim(n=1000,model=list( ar=c(phi1) ), sd=sigmaz)
# simulates from the AR(1) model
ts.plot(y) # plot the time series
acf(y) # provides a plot of the sample autocorrelation function (ACF)
lines (0:100, ARMAacf(ar=c(phi1),ma= c(0),lag.max=100) , col=2)
#add the theoretical acf for the model 
```
```{r chunk5}
n <- 1000 # state the sample size
x <- numeric(n) # define a vector of length n where the simulated values
# of the process are going to be stored stored.
x[1] <- rnorm(1,0,sigmaz)
# set the first value to be random Gaussian white noise
z <- rnorm(n,0,sigmaz) #Gaussian white noise
for (t in 2:n) {
x[t] <- phi1*x[t-1] + z[t]
}
# rnorm(n,mu,sigma) simulates a vector of n
# i.i.d. observations from Normal(mu,sigma^2)
ts.plot(x)
acf(x) #sample acf
lines (0:100, ARMAacf(ar=c(phi1),ma= c(0),lag.max=100) , col=2)
#add the theoretical acf for the model
```
